This project is a simple video player with a Font Awesome play button overlay. It includes a muted, autoplaying video that fits the screen and a central play button icon, which appears when the video is paused or ends. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to control video playback, positioning the button using CSS for a clean, centered look. JavaScript event listeners handle play and pause functionality, dynamically showing or hiding the play button based on video status. Font Awesome is included via CDN to provide the play button icon, ensuring the project is lightweight and easy to set up.
